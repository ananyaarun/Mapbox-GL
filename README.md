# Humanitarian OpenStreetMap

This repository contains my contributions to OpenStreetMap.
As a part of contributing to OSM i have succesfully done the following:
1) Create geojson points 
2) Set up my own vector tile server using Docker
3) extract OSM data
4) visualise map 

# The repository conrains the following files:

# 1) Geojson files
   places.geojson and stationas.geojson
   These files contain Geojson points that can be incorporated to create a layer of points on a map.
   It was created with the help of MapboxGL.I learnt how map layers are specified via geojson files.
   
# 2) Docker 
  I started on the project by understanding how open street maps work end to end. I installed docker and setup a map server
  locally.Here are the step by step instructions i followed to achieve the same
